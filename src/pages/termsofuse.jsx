					Citywide ATM & ATM BAZAAR will honor the Manufacturer’s warranty on

				<p>Damaged Items</p>
				<p>
					It is the responsibility of the customer to ensure that all items are
					accounted for and in proper order before signing for a delivery. If
					you discover that your product is damaged or any items are missing,
					please contact us immediately. You may choose to accept the order if
					only part of your order is damaged or is missing. If your order
					includes an ATM which is damaged, please do not refuse your shipment
					and contact us immediately. We will either file claims with the
					carriers and/or manufacturers or help you file such claims. Please do
					not discard any packaging and documents contained with your order. You
					will need to take pictures of the damages for us, the freight
					carriers, and/or the manufacturers. Please take these pictures and
					email them to us together with your invoice number and explanation of
					the damages. Please email all to sales@citywideatm.com.
				</p>
				<p>Returns</p>
				<p>
					To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same
					condition that you received it. It must also be in the original
					packaging. All items must be returned within 30 days of the original
					order. If 30 days have gone by since your purchase, unfortunately we
					can’t offer you a refund or exchange. A restocking fee applies to all
					returns and exchanges as well as all applicable shipping and handling
					charges. ATM Machines are excluded and may not be returned or
					exchanged except in the circumstances outlined under Damaged Items
					above.
				</p>
				<p>Exchanges</p>

					We only replace items if they are defective or damaged. If you need to
					exchange it for the same item, send us an email at
					tony@citywideatm.com
				</p>
				<p>Refunds</p>
				<p>
					Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email
					to notify you that we have received your returned item. We will also
					notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund. If you are
					approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will
					automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of
					payment, within a certain amount of days.
				</p>
				<p>Canceled Orders</p>
				<p>
					You may only cancel your order by calling or emailing us.
					Cancellations may be subject to shipping and handling fee and
					restocking fee.
