			'At Cetrix, we are committed to our steadfast goal of supplying certified PPE to schools, businesses, and government agencies. While the rapid manufacturing and distribution of vaccines has spurred hope that the end of this pandemic is in sight, now is not the time to let down our collective guard. Maintaining proper safety protocols, such as social distancing and wearing masks, will be essential in driving down the infection rate even further. With this in mind, Cetrix will continue to offer the highest quality masks, gloves, face shields, and other products that have been proven to slow the spread of this virus. As such is the case with many companies, the pandemic has changed our business model. We have moved from manufacturing and designing mobile computing devices and integrated mobile technologies for vertical markets, to offering high quality PPE and ramping up production of UV disinfectant cabinets.',
